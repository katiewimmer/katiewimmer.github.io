<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 1 - What are open source licenses and why should you care? How should you choose one?  </h2>

 <p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> An open source license details the conditions by which the code can be used and how and to whom it may be distributed. It also can dictate the level of transparency when it comes to the source code and if a patent license is required by the software supplier. There are hundreds of different licenses that make many specifications about code and libraries. When using open-source code, it is pivotal that it is properly documented and its usage complies with all of the standards that are outlined in the license type. In the fast-moving world of software development, incorporating open-source code contributions can speed up the process of big projects and give developers a chance to avoid writing sections of code that are already available to the public. This practice is efficient for many large projects, but constructing a vast network of files, recognizing the licenses of open-source code contributions is commonly overlooked. Certain demands that are not met can result in copytheft, lawsuits, a requirement to make the source code available to the public and improper uses of the code. A couple of major companies have failed to properly comply with open-source licensing and have had to deal with major problems in distributing their product to users and having to provide monetary compensation for the violation. When packaging a project, it is very important to select an open-source license that properly outlines what precautions or steps that should be taken when another party wants to use that code. For a basic licensing agreement, the MIT license is relatively straightforward and allows for widespread access and usage privileges for others. However, if you do not want others to distribute your code without providing complete access to your source code, the GNU GPLv3 restricts this from happening. It allows for others to see and make improvements to your code, but sets guidelines about how they further distribute it. The major difference is a requirement to provide the source code to all further recipients, the Mozilla Public License also requires this but others such as the Apache License and the Boost Software License do not require this. Most licenses, although, do allow for certain actions such as commercial use, distribution, modification and private use, which allow the code to undergo large or small change and be used in projects that will eventually interact with users. Another note to make is that it’s recommended though, that if the code is being written or designed by a community, that it is favored by all of the contributors. When working with other developers in a collaborative environment the license decision should be widely accepted and fit for the type of project the community is working on.

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 2 - How do companies and programmers who work with primarily open-source code make money?</h2>

<p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> When hearing about licenses and how harmful having to release open code is when it is not desired, it is interesting to wonder: how could a company possibly make money and use large amounts of open-source code? First off, it is important to consider that some programmers solely produce open-source code for the love of coding and are not seeking something of monetary value for their contributions to the world of computer science. Yet, some companies will actually pay programmers to contribute to open-source libraries. They pay programmers who aim to continue the process of refining the code and making it better. These programmers can also be called upon to tweak their open-source code to fit the specific needs of the company. Additionally, they can be compensated for creating plugins or other features because they are extremely familiar with the code. When it comes to companies, however, the methods of making money are a little different. One important thing to remember is that for the company to be open-source, it does not require that all of their code is open source and they can still keep a certain amount private. This select privatization can require users to pay in order to have access to the completely functioning piece of software. Another way for large companies to make money is by offering training to accompany their open-source programs. More complicated programs to use offer paid guidance into understanding how to use the program, although the program itself is free. Companies can also include advertisements within their software’s source code in order to make money when people access it. This still maintains the concept of open-source code because the code is still free and readily available to the users despite having an advertisement that accompanies the code. While open-source companies may not have access to the same type of monopoly and private coding communities that others may, they are still able to maintain a steady flow of income.

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 3 - Can too many contributions to the open-source community actually be harmful? </h2>
 
<p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> For the past few years in the month of October, DigitalOcean has promoted an event known as “Hacktoberfest,” which is intended to spark more activity and participation in the open-source community. They offer t-shirts to any user that contributes to an open-source repository with pull requests, however the event has begun to threaten the sustainability of OSS. Even though there is increased activity on many open-source repositories, the number of low-quality pull requests have created spam problems for those who maintain and oversee them. With hundreds of users making minor and ineffective contributions for a free t-shirt, they are burdening those who work in OSS with the task of checking for and eliminating useless pull requests, wasting their time and infringing on the benefits of the repository being open-source. DigitialOcean’s attempt to broaden the community of those who participate in GitHub pull requests has put those who oversee open-source repositories in a difficult position, as they are unable to escape the onslaught of these pull-requests. Many commentators have suggested possible solutions to the problem of Hacktoberfest. The most obvious answer is to end the event all together, but it must be considered that numerous repositories immensely benefit from the pull requests received during October and it would be detrimental to some repositories to cancel such an impactful event. Another suggestion was that the only repositories included in the event would have to opt-in and willingly take on the task of sorting through all the pull requests, so that unsuspecting projects couldn’t encounter any large scale spam attacks without consenting to their own participation. It was also suggested that DigitalOcean monitor the pull requests directly and abstain from granting points for worthless contributions. DigitalOcean could also completely disqualify any participant that has one of their pull requests labeled as spam. Some repository owners have even taken this suggestion into their own hands when it comes to lousy contributions and will scold the authors of unwanted pull-requests. This method, though, strains the friendliness of the open-source community and places another burden on those who maintain open-source repositories. It is very difficult to select a solution that adequately addresses all of these problems, but DigitalOcean should consider canceling the event and just work towards encouraging users to contribute on a more regular basis. If they really want to support the open source community, they should use the funds from distributing t-shirts to pay programmers to contribute. While Hacktoberfest sounds like a fantastic idea in theory, it would be for the best of OSS, that it not continue and companies seek out other ways of motivating more coders to participate in open source contributions. </p>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 4 - What role have women played in the open-source movement? What are recent gendered trends? </h2>
 
<p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> When we look into the history of open-source contribution, particularly through the lens and data statistics of FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software) and surveys of open-source community members, the majority of the achievements and developments come from the all encompassing term “contributors.” Yet, the demographic of those who have made the OSS community what it is today is often overlooked. Who were the people that designed the world of computer science we operate in today? The answer to this question is wildly complex, but one thing is certain from analyzing some old and recent statistics: it was, for the most part, not women. When we look at FLOSS and their data on when users began to contribute, we can see that men have been contributing to FLOSS since before 1960. Whereas when we look at the statistics for women, the number of contributors begins to rise during the mid 1990s. Despite more women beginning to take part in OSS, a 2002 study by FLOSS showed that only 1.1% of the contributors were female, revealing the insignificance of the rise in women’s participation in OSS. Even though more women were contributing, their numbers were almost insignificant in the shadow of male contributors. However, in more recent surveys the percentage of female contributors has increased since 2002. In 2013, women were represented as 10% of the open-source contributors, but it must be noted that the majority of these “contributions” were not directly related to the software. Women were finding more of a role in open-source, but were not involved in that actual writing and editing of code. Even outside of the OSS community, women are only responsible for 18% of bachelor’s degrees in computer science, which is another issue that can explain the lack of software-related contributions. In 2017, a survey showed that only 3% of the contributors in a 5,500 FLOSS user sample were women. Even though the percentage has increased, it has only risen by less than 2% in almost two decades. It is clear that male contributors are the main force behind the open-source movement and in the computer science world in general, but what is the benefit of closing this massive gender gap? First off, attracting more women to open-source will overall increase the number of contributors and the number of people that bring their knowledge towards positive technological innovation. Secondly, a more diverse community of coders can bring about new perspectives and increase the number of new ideas that are brought to open-source repositories. Github should do more to encourage female users to contribute their knowledge to the community and current contributors should seek to make Github a safe place for both male and female members. This sense of building an all-inclusive community can even begin in educational communities as well as in the world of computer science.</p>

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 5 - How to maintain a good community of open-source contributors? </h2>
 
<p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> After learning about the importance of having a diverse group of contributors, it is interesting to learn about what else makes a group of coders effective in building a respectful and efficient community. Before examining what behavior is acceptable and or detrimental to a project, it is necessary to understand the different roles people may have in an open source project. The structure of a project and which members perform what tasks is heavily dependent on the project itself, but there are some notable commonalities between most open-source projects. First off, there is often a leader or head decision maker that oversees a project. In some cases this responsibility can be a small group of people that have the final say on any changes made to the code or overall user appeal. Secondly, there are several maintainers of the project who are in charge of a specific portion or section of the project. They have control over what happens with a certain aspect of the code or manage the development of one or two of the project’s goals. Following those who supervise, committers and contributors are able to make edits to the code with varying levels of supervision. Some of the more trusted members of a project are able to directly commit changes to a project, whereas some contributors are subject to approval from a maintainer. A strong relationship and good communication between these varying roles of an open-source project is essential to its success. Leaders and maintainers must be effective in expressing their vision for the project and making sure that it is well communicated to contributors. Constant dialogue and concisely voiced goals allow for those who are committing directly to the code to understand the direction of the project and how they can better contribute. Another important skill a maintainer or leader must have is the ability to uphold the friendliness of the community. The tone they set is pivotal to the culture embodied by those who are contributing to the project. In addition, they must be able say no and keep the best intentions of the project in mind as well. It is also essential that the workload is split well between maintainers and with other contributors as well. Contributors should make sure they properly acknowledge varying perspectives and respond kindly to feedback from maintainers and other contributors. Using kind and friendly language, as well as the occasional “thank you,” can go a really long way in an open-source community. It is important to develop a good understanding of the project’s goal and the vision of the maintainers before taking on a new vision of the project, while also bringing a new perspective to the project. Finding a good balance between complying with the desires of the maintainers and bringing in unique viewpoints is tedious but can lead to really impactful contributions. Overall, having a general respect for all of those who help to build a project is a defining characteristic of a healthy and efficient community. Politeness and hardwork are also important practices, as well as concise and consistent communication. </p>
