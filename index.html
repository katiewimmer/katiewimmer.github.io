<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 1 - What are open source licenses and why should you care? How should you choose one?  </h2>

 <p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> An open source license details the conditions by which the code can be used and how and to whom it may be distributed. It also can dictate the level of transparency when it comes to the source code and if a patent license is required by the software supplier. There are hundreds of different licenses that make many specifications about code and libraries. When using open-source code, it is pivotal that it is properly documented and its usage complies with all of the standards that are outlined in the license type. In the fast-moving world of software development, incorporating open-source code contributions can speed up the process of big projects and give developers a chance to avoid writing sections of code that are already available to the public. This practice is efficient for many large projects, but constructing a vast network of files, recognizing the licenses of open-source code contributions is commonly overlooked. Certain demands that are not met can result in copytheft, lawsuits, a requirement to make the source code available to the public and improper uses of the code. A couple of major companies have failed to properly comply with open-source licensing and have had to deal with major problems in distributing their product to users and having to provide monetary compensation for the violation. When packaging a project, it is very important to select an open-source license that properly outlines what precautions or steps that should be taken when another party wants to use that code. For a basic licensing agreement, the MIT license is relatively straightforward and allows for widespread access and usage privileges for others. However, if you do not want others to distribute your code without providing complete access to your source code, the GNU GPLv3 restricts this from happening. It allows for others to see and make improvements to your code, but sets guidelines about how they further distribute it. The major difference is a requirement to provide the source code to all further recipients, the Mozilla Public License also requires this but others such as the Apache License and the Boost Software License do not require this. Most licenses, although, do allow for certain actions such as commercial use, distribution, modification and private use, which allow the code to undergo large or small change and be used in projects that will eventually interact with users. Another note to make is that it’s recommended though, that if the code is being written or designed by a community, that it is favored by all of the contributors. When working with other developers in a collaborative environment the license decision should be widely accepted and fit for the type of project the community is working on.

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 2 - How do companies and programmers who work with primarily open-source code make money?</h2>

<p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> When hearing about licenses and how harmful having to release open code is when it is not desired, it is interesting to wonder: how could a company possibly make money and use large amounts of open-source code? First off, it is important to consider that some programmers solely produce open-source code for the love of coding and are not seeking something of monetary value for their contributions to the world of computer science. Yet, some companies will actually pay programmers to contribute to open-source libraries. They pay programmers who aim to continue the process of refining the code and making it better. These programmers can also be called upon to tweak their open-source code to fit the specific needs of the company. Additionally, they can be compensated for creating plugins or other features because they are extremely familiar with the code. When it comes to companies, however, the methods of making money are a little different. One important thing to remember is that for the company to be open-source, it does not require that all of their code is open source and they can still keep a certain amount private. This select privatization can require users to pay in order to have access to the completely functioning piece of software. Another way for large companies to make money is by offering training to accompany their open-source programs. More complicated programs to use offer paid guidance into understanding how to use the program, although the program itself is free. Companies can also include advertisements within their software’s source code in order to make money when people access it. This still maintains the concept of open-source code because the code is still free and readily available to the users despite having an advertisement that accompanies the code. While open-source companies may not have access to the same type of monopoly and private coding communities that others may, they are still able to maintain a steady flow of income.

<h2 style="color:DarkBlue;"> Week 3 - Can too many contributions to the open-source community actually be harmful? </h2>
 
<p style="border:2px solid DeepSkyBlue;"> For the past few years in the month of October, DigitalOcean has promoted an event known as “Hacktoberfest,” which is intended to spark more activity and participation in the open-source community. They offer t-shirts to any user that contributes to an open-source repository with pull requests, however the event has begun to threaten the sustainability of OSS. Even though there is increased activity on many open-source repositories, the number of low-quality pull requests have created spam problems for those who maintain and oversee them. With hundreds of users making minor and ineffective contributions for a free t-shirt, they are burdening those who work in OSS with the task of checking for and eliminating useless pull requests, wasting their time and infringing on the benefits of the repository being open-source. DigitialOcean’s attempt to broaden the community of those who participate in GitHub pull requests has put those who oversee open-source repositories in a difficult position, as they are unable to escape the onslaught of these pull-requests. Many commentators have suggested possible solutions to the problem of Hacktoberfest. The most obvious answer is to end the event all together, but it must be considered that numerous repositories immensely benefit from the pull requests received during October and it would be detrimental to some repositories to cancel such an impactful event. Another suggestion was that the only repositories included in the event would have to opt-in and willingly take on the task of sorting through all the pull requests, so that unsuspecting projects couldn’t encounter any large scale spam attacks without consenting to their own participation. It was also suggested that DigitalOcean monitor the pull requests directly and abstain from granting points for worthless contributions. DigitalOcean could also completely disqualify any participant that has one of their pull requests labeled as spam. Some repository owners have even taken this suggestion into their own hands when it comes to lousy contributions and will scold the authors of unwanted pull-requests. This method, though, strains the friendliness of the open-source community and places another burden on those who maintain open-source repositories. It is very difficult to select a solution that adequately addresses all of these problems, but DigitalOcean should consider canceling the event and just work towards encouraging users to contribute on a more regular basis. If they really want to support the open source community, they should use the funds from distributing t-shirts to pay programmers to contribute. While Hacktoberfest sounds like a fantastic idea in theory, it would be for the best of OSS, that it not continue and companies seek out other ways of motivating more coders to participate in open source contributions. </p>
